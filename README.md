# What is this?
These are some of my BASIC programs I did as a child first on the ZX-81, which I converted to the C64 around a year later and finally at the age of 12 on the AMIGA 500. They are in german as I did them in german when I was a child. If you want to compare have a look [here](https://github.com/SJakubinek/ZX-81-BASIC-Programs) and [there](https://github.com/SJakubinek/C64-BASIC-Programs)

## count1to10
Just a very simple program. It counts from 1 to 10. But imagine you're 5.5 years old in 1981 and this was your very first own program. It was pure magic to me!

## count1to100
As you had to force the ZX-81 to do a CLS after x lines, it wasn't necessary on the C64. Anyway I converted it.

## hallo
"Hello World" ... The funny part about this is it wasn't my first program like it is usually. I even can't tell you why, but I think I ever liked math more then languages/words.

## 10hallo
Well this prints "HALLO" 10 times onto the screen. Nothing else.

## zahlenraten
Usually you had to guess the number the computer picked. I made it the opposite way. Yes, you can cheat. But why you should cheat?!

# How to use
Type them in on the real machine or your prefered emulator.

# About me
I started programming at the age of 5 1/2 when a ZX-81 moved into our house.

The first program I typed in was from a book and it was [Wolf, goat and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem). Then I got addicted and wanted to learn more and more. Thankfully there was a manual in which all the commands where described with some examples.

When people asked me what I want to do for a living, when grown up I immediatly answered:"I wanna programm stuff!" So I followed this dream ever since.
