# What is this?
These are some of my BASIC programs I did as a child first on the ZX-81, which I converted to the C64 around a year later and finally at the age of 12 on the AMIGA 500. They are in german as I did them in german when I was a child. If you want to compare have a look [here](https://github.com/SJakubinek/ZX-81-BASIC-Programs) and [there](https://github.com/SJakubinek/C64-BASIC-Programs)

## count1to10
Just a very simple program. It counts from 1 to 10. But imagine you're 5.5 years old in 1981 and this was your very first own program. It was pure magic to me!

## count1to100
As you had to force the ZX-81 to do a CLS after x lines, it wasn't necessary on the C64. Anyway I converted it.

## hallo
"Hello World" ... The funny part about this is it wasn't my first program like it is usually. I even can't tell you why, but I think I ever liked math more then languages/words.

## 10hallo
Well this prints "HALLO" 10 times onto the screen. Nothing else.

## zahlenraten
Usually you had to guess the number the computer picked. I made it the opposite way. Yes, you can cheat. But why you should cheat?!

## taschenrechner
I got into school and sadly we weren't adding numbers or substracting or whatever. No, instead we had to paint circles around things that were of the same type and count them. Boring! At home I wrote this little program, which I later may or may not have used for my homework. ;)

## timer
This small timer uses frames to calculate the time a program, loop or whatever needed to be executed. It's not that accurate as it uses the frames for refreshing the TV. The timer I created is for Germany as it uses 50Hz instead of the 60Hz used in the USA. Also keep in mind that the frames are decreased. So sometimes you end up with a negative number, when it starts again after 65535.

## primzahlen
This is just the sieve of Eratosthenes. Nothing special. The variable N can't be higher than 2851 on a machine with 16kB RAM.

# About me
I started programming at the age of 5 1/2 when a ZX-81 moved into our house.

The first program I typed in was from a book and it was [Wolf, goat and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem). Then I got addicted and wanted to learn more and more. Thankfully there was a manual in which all the commands where described with some examples.

When people asked me what I want to do for a living, when grown up I immediatly answered:"I wanna programm stuff!" So I followed this dream ever since.
